# BurntCookieDetectionPickAndPlace
The Burnt Cookie Detection project aims to develop an automated system to identify overcooked or burnt cookies during the baking process using OpenCV and machine learning algorithms. This system leverages Python 2.7 for image processing and classification, while Arduino is used for interfacing with sensors and controlling the baking process
